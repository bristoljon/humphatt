      We decided to do<br/>
      The decent thing<br/>
      On our first family holiday<br/>
      Jon gave me a ring
    </p>
    <p>
      On xx/xx/xxxx date<br/>
      We'd love you to come<br/>
      And join us for<br/>
      A weekend of fun
    </p>
    <p>
      We'll say our vows<br/>
      With close friends and family<br/>
      Then join you all<br/>
      For a bit fatty party<br/>
    </p>
    <p>
      Our wedding won't follow<br/>
      The standard flow<br/>
      As we'd like everyone<br/>
      To have a go<br/>
    </p>
    <p>
      We want to celebrate<br/>
      Your talents and imagination<br/>
      Our vision is<br/>
      A homegrown creation<br/>
    </p>
    <p>
      Rather than giving us<br/>
      Material things<br/>
      Your creativity,<br/>
      We'd like you to bring<br/>
    </p>
    <p>
      Read us a poem<br/>
      Or bake us a cake<br/>
      Juggle with fire sticks<br/>
      Or give your booty a shake<br/>
    </p>
    <p>
      On this site<br/>
      You can book a slot<br/>
      And through the weekend<br/>
      Show us what you've got<br/>
    </p>
    <p>
      Tell us what<br/>
      You plan to do<br/>
      Or keep it a secret<br/>
      It's up to you<br/>
    </p>
  </div>);
